Image generation with Gemini (aka Nano Banana 🍌)

content_copy



Gemini can generate and process images conversationally. You can prompt Gemini with text, images, or a combination of both, allowing you to create, edit, and iterate on visuals with unprecedented control:

Text-to-Image: Generate high-quality images from simple or complex text descriptions.
Image + Text-to-Image (Editing): Provide an image and use text prompts to add, remove, or modify elements, change the style, or adjust the color grading.
Multi-Image to Image (Composition & style transfer): Use multiple input images to compose a new scene or transfer the style from one image to another.
Iterative refinement: Engage in a conversation to progressively refine your image over multiple turns, making small adjustments until it's perfect.
High-Fidelity text rendering: Accurately generate images that contain legible and well-placed text, ideal for logos, diagrams, and posters.
All generated images include a SynthID watermark.

This guide describes both the fast Gemini 2.5 Flash and the advanced Gemini 3 Pro Preview image models, with examples of capabilities from basic text-to-image to complex, multi-turn refinements, 4K output, and search-grounded generation.

Model selection
Choose the model best suited for your specific use case.

Gemini 3 Pro Image Preview (Nano Banana Pro Preview) is designed for professional asset production and complex instructions. This model features real-world grounding using Google Search, a default "Thinking" process that refines composition prior to generation, and can generate images of up to 4K resolutions.

Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (Nano Banana) is designed for speed and efficiency. This model is optimized for high-volume, low-latency tasks and generates images at 1024px resolution.

Grounding with Google Search
Use the Google Search tool to generate images based on real-time information, such as weather forecasts, stock charts, or recent events.

Notes to consider when using Grounding with Google Search with image generation:

Image-based search results are not passed to the generation model and are excluded from the response.
Image only mode (responseModalities = ["IMAGE"]) won't return an image output when used with Grounding with Google Search.

The response includes groundingMetadata which contains the following required fields:

searchEntryPoint: Contains the HTML and CSS to render the required search suggestions.
groundingChunks: Returns the top 3 web sources used to ground the generated image
Generate images up to 4K resolution
Gemini 3 Pro Image generates 1K images by default but can also output 2K and 4K images. To generate higher resolution assets, specify the image_size in the generation_config.

You must use an uppercase 'K' (e.g., 1K, 2K, 4K). Lowercase parameters (e.g., 1k) will be rejected.

Thinking Process
The Gemini 3 Pro Image Preview model is a thinking model and uses a reasoning process ("Thinking") for complex prompts. This feature is enabled by default and cannot be disabled in the API. To learn more about the thinking process, see the Gemini Thinking guide.

The model generates up to two interim images to test composition and logic. The last image within Thinking is also the final rendered image.

You can check the thoughts that lead to the final image being produced.

Python
Javascript

for part in response.parts:
    if part.thought:
        if part.text:
            print(part.text)
        elif image:= part.as_image():
            image.show()
Thought Signatures
Thought signatures are encrypted representations of the model's internal thought process and are used to preserve reasoning context across multi-turn interactions. All responses include a thought_signature field. As a general rule, if you receive a thought signature in a model response, you should pass it back exactly as received when sending the conversation history in the next turn. Failure to circulate thought signatures may cause the response to fail. Check the thought signature documentation for more explanations of signatures overall.

Note: If you use the official Google Gen AI SDKs and use the chat feature (or append the full model response object directly to history), thought signatures are handled automatically. You do not need to manually extract or manage them, or change your code.
Here is how thought signatures work:

All inline_data parts with image mimetype which are part of the response should have signature.
If there are some text parts at the beginning (before any image) right after the thoughts, the first text part should also have a signature.
Thoughts do not have signatures; If inline_data parts with image mimetype are part of thoughts, they will not have signatures.
The following code shows an example of where thought signatures are included:


[
  {
    "inline_data": {
      "data": "<base64_image_data_0>",
      "mime_type": "image/png"
    },

Other image generation modes
Gemini supports other image interaction modes based on prompt structure and context, including:

Text to image(s) and text (interleaved): Outputs images with related text.
Example prompt: "Generate an illustrated recipe for a paella."
Image(s) and text to image(s) and text (interleaved): Uses input images and text to create new related images and text.
Example prompt: (With an image of a furnished room) "What other color sofas would work in my space? can you update the image?"
Prompting guide and strategies
Mastering image generation starts with one fundamental principle:

Describe the scene, don't just list keywords. The model's core strength is its deep language understanding. A narrative, descriptive paragraph will almost always produce a better, more coherent image than a list of disconnected words.

Prompts for generating images
The following strategies will help you create effective prompts to generate exactly the images you're looking for.

1. Photorealistic scenes
For realistic images, use photography terms. Mention camera angles, lens types, lighting, and fine details to guide the model toward a photorealistic result.

Best Practices
To elevate your results from good to great, incorporate these professional strategies into your workflow.

Be Hyper-Specific: The more detail you provide, the more control you have. Instead of "fantasy armor," describe it: "ornate elven plate armor, etched with silver leaf patterns, with a high collar and pauldrons shaped like falcon wings."
Provide Context and Intent: Explain the purpose of the image. The model's understanding of context will influence the final output. For example, "Create a logo for a high-end, minimalist skincare brand" will yield better results than just "Create a logo."
Iterate and Refine: Don't expect a perfect image on the first try. Use the conversational nature of the model to make small changes. Follow up with prompts like, "That's great, but can you make the lighting a bit warmer?" or "Keep everything the same, but change the character's expression to be more serious."
Use Step-by-Step Instructions: For complex scenes with many elements, break your prompt into steps. "First, create a background of a serene, misty forest at dawn. Then, in the foreground, add a moss-covered ancient stone altar. Finally, place a single, glowing sword on top of the altar."
Use "Semantic Negative Prompts": Instead of saying "no cars," describe the desired scene positively: "an empty, deserted street with no signs of traffic."
Control the Camera: Use photographic and cinematic language to control the composition. Terms like wide-angle shot, macro shot, low-angle perspective.
Limitations
For best performance, use the following languages: EN, es-MX, ja-JP, zh-CN, hi-IN.
Image generation does not support audio or video inputs.
The model won't always follow the exact number of image outputs that the user explicitly asks for.
The model works best with up to 3 images as an input.
When generating text for an image, Gemini works best if you first generate the text and then ask for an image with the text.
All generated images include a SynthID watermark.
Optional configurations
You can optionally configure the response modalities and aspect ratio of the model's output in the config field of generate_content calls.

Output types
The model defaults to returning text and image responses (i.e. response_modalities=['Text', 'Image']). You can configure the response to return only images without text using response_modalities=['Image'].

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST

-d '{
  "contents": [{
    "parts": [
      {"text": "Create a picture of a nano banana dish in a fancy restaurant with a Gemini theme"}
    ]
  }],
  "generationConfig": {
    "responseModalities": ["Image"]
  }
}' \
Aspect ratios
The model defaults to matching the output image size to that of your input image, or otherwise generates 1:1 squares. You can control the aspect ratio of the output image using the aspect_ratio field under image_config in the response request, shown here:

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST

-d '{
  "contents": [{
    "parts": [
      {"text": "Create a picture of a nano banana dish in a fancy restaurant with a Gemini theme"}
    ]
  }],
  "generationConfig": {
    "imageConfig": {
      "aspectRatio": "16:9"
    }
  }
}' \
The different ratios available and the size of the image generated are listed in the following tables:

When to use Imagen
In addition to using Gemini's built-in image generation capabilities, you can also access Imagen, our specialized image generation model, through the Gemini API.

Attribute	Imagen	Gemini Native Image
Strengths	Model specializes in image generation.	Default recommendation.
Unparalleled flexibility, contextual understanding, and simple, mask-free editing. Uniquely capable of multi-turn conversational editing.
Availability	Generally available	Preview (Production usage allowed)
Latency	Low. Optimized for near-real-time performance.	Higher. More computation is required for its advanced capabilities.
Cost	Cost-effective for specialized tasks. $0.02/image to $0.12/image	Token-based pricing. $30 per 1 million tokens for image output (image output tokenized at 1290 tokens per image flat, up to 1024x1024px)
Recommended tasks	
Image quality, photorealism, artistic detail, or specific styles (e.g., impressionism, anime) are top priorities.
Infusing branding, style, or generating logos and product designs.
Generating advanced spelling or typography.
Interleaved text and image generation to seamlessly blend text and images.
Combine creative elements from multiple images with a single prompt.
Make highly specific edits to images, modify individual elements with simple language commands, and iteratively work on an image.
Apply a specific design or texture from one image to another while preserving the original subject's form and details.
Imagen 4 should be your go-to model when starting to generate images with Imagen. Choose Imagen 4 Ultra for advanced use-cases or when you need the best image quality (note that can only generate one image at a time).
